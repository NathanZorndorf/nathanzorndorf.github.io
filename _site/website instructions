How to export jupyter notebooks to my website:
1. Download notebook as html file 
2. Move file to /_posts folder
3. rename file with convention and replace .html with .md
4. Add header to top of file, like so:
	---
	title: "Example: Performing One Sample Z-Tests and t-Tests in Python"
	layout: "notebook"
	excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->"
	categories:
	  # - Blog
	  - Statistics
	tags:
	  - Z-Test
	  - T-Test
	  - Python
	  - Statistical Inference
	---
5. If you don't want a post excerpt to appear under the title of the post, then include <!--more--> just above the line that contains <!DOCTYPE html> and make sure excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->" is contained in the text in step 4.
